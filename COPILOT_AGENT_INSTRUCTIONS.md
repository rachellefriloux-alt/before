# Copilot Coding Agent Instructions

This repository uses GitHub Copilot's coding agent for automated code changes, reviews, and task management. To ensure best practices and smooth collaboration, please follow these guidelines:

## 1. Task Management
- Use structured TODO lists for multi-step or complex work.
- Mark tasks as `not-started`, `in-progress`, or `completed`.
- Update the TODO list after each step to maintain visibility.

## 2. Code Changes
- Prefer atomic, focused commits for each change.
- Use clear, descriptive commit messages.
- Reference related issues or PRs in commit messages when applicable.

## 3. Reviews & Collaboration
- Review Copilot agent PRs for correctness and completeness.
- Provide actionable feedback in PR comments.
- Use GitHub's review tools to approve or request changes.

## 4. Automation & Workflows
- Ensure CI/CD workflows are up-to-date and compatible with Copilot agent automation.
- Use status checks to validate agent changes before merging.

## 5. Security & Privacy
- Do not commit secrets, credentials, or sensitive data.
- Review agent-generated code for security vulnerabilities.

## 6. Documentation
- Document new features, changes, and architectural decisions in the repository's docs.
- Update README and relevant documentation after major changes.

## 7. Communication
- Use clear, concise language in issues, PRs, and comments.
- Tag relevant team members for visibility when needed.
