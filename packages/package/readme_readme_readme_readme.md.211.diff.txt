---- DIFF ----
Browser-friendly inheritance fully compatible with standard node.js
[inherits](http://nodejs.org/api/util.html#util_util_inherits_constructor_superconstructor).
This package exports standard `inherits` from node.js `util` module in
node environment, but also provides alternative browser-friendly
implementation through [browser
field](https://gist.github.com/shtylman/4339901). Alternative
implementation is a literal copy of standard one located in standalone
module to avoid requiring of `util`. It also has a shim for old
browsers with no `Object.create` support.
While keeping you sure you are using standard `inherits`
implementation in node.js environment, it allows bundlers such as
[browserify](https://github.com/substack/node-browserify) to not
include full `util` package to your client code if all you need is
just `inherits` function. It worth, because browser shim for `util`
package is large and `inherits` is often the single function you need
from it.
It's recommended to use this package instead of
`require('util').inherits` for any code that has chances to be used
not only in node.js but in browser too.
var inherits = require('inherits');
// then use exactly as the standard one
## note on version ~1.0
Version ~1.0 had completely different motivation and is not compatible
neither with 2.0 nor with standard node.js `inherits`.
If you are using version ~1.0 and planning to switch to ~2.0, be
careful:
* new version uses `super_` instead of `super` for referencing
  superclass
* new version overwrites current prototype while old one preserves any
  existing fields on it

> Tiny queue data structure
You should use this package instead of an array if you do a lot of `Array#push()` and `Array#shift()` on large arrays, since `Array#shift()` has [linear time complexity](https://medium.com/@ariel.salem1989/an-easy-to-use-guide-to-big-o-time-complexity-5dcf4be8a444#:~:text=O(N)%E2%80%94Linear%20Time) *O(n)* while `Queue#dequeue()` has [constant time complexity](https://medium.com/@ariel.salem1989/an-easy-to-use-guide-to-big-o-time-complexity-5dcf4be8a444#:~:text=O(1)%20%E2%80%94%20Constant%20Time) *O(1)*. That makes a huge difference for large arrays.
> A [queue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queue_(abstract_data_type)) is an ordered list of elements where an element is inserted at the end of the queue and is removed from the front of the queue. A queue works based on the first-in, first-out ([FIFO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFO_(computing_and_electronics))) principle.
## Install
$ npm install yocto-queue
```
const Queue = require('yocto-queue');
const queue = new Queue();

queue.enqueue('🦄');
queue.enqueue('🌈');

console.log(queue.size);
//=> 2

console.log(...queue);
//=> '🦄 🌈'
console.log(queue.dequeue());
//=> '🦄'

console.log(queue.dequeue());
//=> '🌈'
```

## API

### `queue = new Queue()`

The instance is an [`Iterable`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Iteration_protocols), which means you can iterate over the queue front to back with a “for…of” loop, or use spreading to convert the queue to an array. Don't do this unless you really need to though, since it's slow.
#### `.enqueue(value)`

Add a value to the queue.

#### `.dequeue()`

Remove the next value in the queue.

Returns the removed value or `undefined` if the queue is empty.

#### `.clear()`

Clear the queue.

#### `.size`

The size of the queue.
