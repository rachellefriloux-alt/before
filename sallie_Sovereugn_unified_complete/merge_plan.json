  "requirements_checklist": [
    "Find every source file across all Sallie versions (all extensions)",
    "Copy all files into a safe `newsal/merged_sources/` area preserving original paths",
    "Remove only exact byte-for-byte duplicates (no loss)",
    "For differing versions of the same logical file: preserve all versions with clear suffixes and produce a single 'merged' candidate file when safe",
    "Merge `package.json` dependency lists into `newsal/package.json` with human review for conflicts",
    "Preserve all original files with provenance metadata (source path + timestamp)"
  ],
  "assumptions": [
    "You want a no-loss consolidation: nothing will be deleted from the original locations",
    "Where automated merging is risky, the plan will create both versions and a candidate merged file for review",
    "We will not modify `newsal` production files until you approve the preview manifest"
  ],
  "planned_steps": [
    "Scan and list every matching source file (non-destructive)",
    "Create `newsal/merged_sources/` with a mirrored directory tree and copy every source file there",
    "Detect exact duplicates and remove duplicates inside `merged_sources` (keeping one copy) — originals remain untouched",
    "Detect filename collisions (same relative path but different content) and preserve both versions as `filename__from__sourceA__timestamp.ext` and `filename__from__sourceB__timestamp.ext`, then create `filename__merged.ext` using a conservative heuristic (prefer `merged_sallie` or newest file) — candidate requires review",
    "Generate a `newsal/merge_report.json` summarizing actions and conflicts for manual review",
    "Optionally integrate merged candidate files into `newsal/src/` and update `newsal/package.json` after your approval"
  ],
  "next_action_offered": "If you approve, I will produce a full preview manifest enumerating every file to be copied and every collision (non-destructive). After you review, I will execute the safe copy + dedupe steps.",
