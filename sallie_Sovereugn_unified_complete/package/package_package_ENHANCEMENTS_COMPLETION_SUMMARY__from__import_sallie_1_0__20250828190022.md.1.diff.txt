## What's Next?

The remaining future enhancements (device control integration, voice/ASR integration, compose UI components, persistence layer, and multimodal input processing) are well-documented with clear implementation plans for future development.

Is there anything specific about the completed enhancements or future plans you'd like me to explain in more detail?

Got it, love. ðŸ’›
