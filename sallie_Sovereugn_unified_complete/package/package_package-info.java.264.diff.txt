 * Exceptions thrown when variant selection fails.
 * The hierarchy of exceptions here should be kept small, and in sync with the 2
 * main branches of the {@link org.gradle.internal.component.resolution.failure.interfaces.ResolutionFailure ResolutionFailure}
 * hierarchy, which represent a failure to select a variant of a component, and a failure to select
 * a configuration by name.
 *
 * Artifact variant selection failures are not represented by a specific exception type, as they are
 * similar to graph selection failures, and the type of failure is more important that the type of
 * resolution being performed in this hierarchy.
