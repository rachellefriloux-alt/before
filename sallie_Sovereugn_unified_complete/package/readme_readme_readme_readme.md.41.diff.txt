# globals
> Global identifiers from different JavaScript environments
It's just a [JSON file](globals.json), so use it in any environment.
This package is used by ESLint.
**This package [no longer accepts](https://github.com/sindresorhus/globals/issues/82) new environments. If you need it for ESLint, just [create a plugin](http://eslint.org/docs/developer-guide/working-with-plugins#environments-in-plugins).**
```sh
npm install globals
const globals = require('globals');
console.log(globals.browser);
/*
{
	addEventListener: false,
	applicationCache: false,
	ArrayBuffer: false,
	atob: false,
	‚Ä¶
}
*/
Each global is given a value of `true` or `false`. A value of `true` indicates that the variable may be overwritten. A value of `false` indicates that the variable should be considered read-only. This information is used by static analysis tools to flag incorrect behavior. We assume all variables should be `false` unless we hear otherwise.
For Node.js this package provides two sets of globals:
- `globals.nodeBuiltin`: Globals available to all code running in Node.js.
	These will usually be available as properties on the `global` object and include `process`, `Buffer`, but not CommonJS arguments like `require`.
	See: https://nodejs.org/api/globals.html
- `globals.node`: A combination of the globals from `nodeBuiltin` plus all CommonJS arguments ("CommonJS module scope").
	See: https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html#modules_the_module_scope
When analyzing code that is known to run outside of a CommonJS wrapper, for example, JavaScript modules, `nodeBuiltin` can find accidental CommonJS references.
# yocto-queue [![](https://badgen.net/bundlephobia/minzip/yocto-queue)](https://bundlephobia.com/result?p=yocto-queue)
> Tiny queue data structure
You should use this package instead of an array if you do a lot of `Array#push()` and `Array#shift()` on large arrays, since `Array#shift()` has [linear time complexity](https://medium.com/@ariel.salem1989/an-easy-to-use-guide-to-big-o-time-complexity-5dcf4be8a444#:~:text=O(N)%E2%80%94Linear%20Time) *O(n)* while `Queue#dequeue()` has [constant time complexity](https://medium.com/@ariel.salem1989/an-easy-to-use-guide-to-big-o-time-complexity-5dcf4be8a444#:~:text=O(1)%20%E2%80%94%20Constant%20Time) *O(1)*. That makes a huge difference for large arrays.
> A [queue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queue_(abstract_data_type)) is an ordered list of elements where an element is inserted at the end of the queue and is removed from the front of the queue. A queue works based on the first-in, first-out ([FIFO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFO_(computing_and_electronics))) principle.
$ npm install yocto-queue
const Queue = require('yocto-queue');
const queue = new Queue();
queue.enqueue('ü¶Ñ');
queue.enqueue('üåà');
console.log(queue.size);
//=> 2

console.log(...queue);
//=> 'ü¶Ñ üåà'

console.log(queue.dequeue());
//=> 'ü¶Ñ'
console.log(queue.dequeue());
//=> 'üåà'
```
## API

### `queue = new Queue()`

The instance is an [`Iterable`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Iteration_protocols), which means you can iterate over the queue front to back with a ‚Äúfor‚Ä¶of‚Äù loop, or use spreading to convert the queue to an array. Don't do this unless you really need to though, since it's slow.
#### `.enqueue(value)`
Add a value to the queue.

#### `.dequeue()`

Remove the next value in the queue.

Returns the removed value or `undefined` if the queue is empty.

#### `.clear()`

Clear the queue.

#### `.size`

The size of the queue.
