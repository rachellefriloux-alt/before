# fast-deep-equal
The fastest deep equal with ES6 Map, Set and Typed arrays support.
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/epoberezkin/fast-deep-equal.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/epoberezkin/fast-deep-equal)
[![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/fast-deep-equal.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fast-deep-equal)
[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/epoberezkin/fast-deep-equal/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/epoberezkin/fast-deep-equal?branch=master)
```bash
npm install fast-deep-equal
## Features
- ES5 compatible
- works in node.js (8+) and browsers (IE9+)
- checks equality of Date and RegExp objects by value.
ES6 equal (`require('fast-deep-equal/es6')`) also supports:
- Maps
- Sets
- Typed arrays
```javascript
var equal = require('fast-deep-equal');
console.log(equal({foo: 'bar'}, {foo: 'bar'})); // true
To support ES6 Maps, Sets and Typed arrays equality use:
```javascript
var equal = require('fast-deep-equal/es6');
console.log(equal(Int16Array([1, 2]), Int16Array([1, 2]))); // true
To use with React (avoiding the traversal of React elements' _owner
property that contains circular references and is not needed when
comparing the elements - borrowed from [react-fast-compare](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/react-fast-compare)):
```javascript
var equal = require('fast-deep-equal/react');
var equal = require('fast-deep-equal/es6/react');
```

The fastest is fast-deep-equal
```
To run benchmark (requires node.js 6+):
```bash
npm run benchmark
```

> Tiny queue data structure
You should use this package instead of an array if you do a lot of `Array#push()` and `Array#shift()` on large arrays, since `Array#shift()` has [linear time complexity](https://medium.com/@ariel.salem1989/an-easy-to-use-guide-to-big-o-time-complexity-5dcf4be8a444#:~:text=O(N)%E2%80%94Linear%20Time) *O(n)* while `Queue#dequeue()` has [constant time complexity](https://medium.com/@ariel.salem1989/an-easy-to-use-guide-to-big-o-time-complexity-5dcf4be8a444#:~:text=O(1)%20%E2%80%94%20Constant%20Time) *O(1)*. That makes a huge difference for large arrays.
> A [queue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queue_(abstract_data_type)) is an ordered list of elements where an element is inserted at the end of the queue and is removed from the front of the queue. A queue works based on the first-in, first-out ([FIFO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFO_(computing_and_electronics))) principle.
$ npm install yocto-queue
```js
const Queue = require('yocto-queue');
const queue = new Queue();
queue.enqueue('ü¶Ñ');
queue.enqueue('üåà');
console.log(queue.size);
//=> 2
console.log(...queue);
//=> 'ü¶Ñ üåà'
console.log(queue.dequeue());
//=> 'ü¶Ñ'
console.log(queue.dequeue());
//=> 'üåà'
## API
### `queue = new Queue()`
The instance is an [`Iterable`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Iteration_protocols), which means you can iterate over the queue front to back with a ‚Äúfor‚Ä¶of‚Äù loop, or use spreading to convert the queue to an array. Don't do this unless you really need to though, since it's slow.
#### `.enqueue(value)`
Add a value to the queue.
#### `.dequeue()`
Remove the next value in the queue.
Returns the removed value or `undefined` if the queue is empty.
#### `.clear()`
Clear the queue.
#### `.size`
The size of the queue.
