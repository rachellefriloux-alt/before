Parse HTTP X-Forwarded-For header
## Installation
This is a [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) module available through the
[npm registry](https://www.npmjs.com/). Installation is done using the
[`npm install` command](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-npm-packages-locally):
```sh
$ npm install forwarded
var forwarded = require('forwarded')
### forwarded(req)
```js
var addresses = forwarded(req)
Parse the `X-Forwarded-For` header from the request. Returns an array
of the addresses, including the socket address for the `req`, in reverse
order (i.e. index `0` is the socket address and the last index is the
furthest address, typically the end-user).
## Testing
```sh
$ npm test
```

# yocto-queue [![](https://badgen.net/bundlephobia/minzip/yocto-queue)](https://bundlephobia.com/result?p=yocto-queue)
> Tiny queue data structure
You should use this package instead of an array if you do a lot of `Array#push()` and `Array#shift()` on large arrays, since `Array#shift()` has [linear time complexity](https://medium.com/@ariel.salem1989/an-easy-to-use-guide-to-big-o-time-complexity-5dcf4be8a444#:~:text=O(N)%E2%80%94Linear%20Time) *O(n)* while `Queue#dequeue()` has [constant time complexity](https://medium.com/@ariel.salem1989/an-easy-to-use-guide-to-big-o-time-complexity-5dcf4be8a444#:~:text=O(1)%20%E2%80%94%20Constant%20Time) *O(1)*. That makes a huge difference for large arrays.
> A [queue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queue_(abstract_data_type)) is an ordered list of elements where an element is inserted at the end of the queue and is removed from the front of the queue. A queue works based on the first-in, first-out ([FIFO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFO_(computing_and_electronics))) principle.
## Install
$ npm install yocto-queue
## Usage
const Queue = require('yocto-queue');
const queue = new Queue();
queue.enqueue('ü¶Ñ');
queue.enqueue('üåà');
console.log(queue.size);
//=> 2
console.log(...queue);
//=> 'ü¶Ñ üåà'

console.log(queue.dequeue());
//=> 'ü¶Ñ'

console.log(queue.dequeue());
//=> 'üåà'
### `queue = new Queue()`

The instance is an [`Iterable`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Iteration_protocols), which means you can iterate over the queue front to back with a ‚Äúfor‚Ä¶of‚Äù loop, or use spreading to convert the queue to an array. Don't do this unless you really need to though, since it's slow.
#### `.enqueue(value)`
Add a value to the queue.
#### `.dequeue()`

Remove the next value in the queue.

Returns the removed value or `undefined` if the queue is empty.

#### `.clear()`

Clear the queue.

#### `.size`

The size of the queue.
