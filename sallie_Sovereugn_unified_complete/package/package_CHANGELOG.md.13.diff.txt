---- DIFF ----
## 0.6.3 / 2021-05-23
  * Fix HKSCS encoding to prefer Big5 codes if both Big5 and HKSCS codes are possible (#264)
## 0.6.2 / 2020-07-08
  * Support Uint8Array-s decoding without conversion to Buffers, plus fix an edge case.
## 0.6.1 / 2020-06-28
  * Support Uint8Array-s directly when decoding (#246, by @gyzerok)
  * Unify package.json version ranges to be strictly semver-compatible (#241)
  * Fix minor issue in UTF-32 decoder's endianness detection code.
## 0.6.0 / 2020-06-08
  * Updated 'gb18030' encoding to :2005 edition (see https://github.com/whatwg/encoding/issues/22).
  * Removed `iconv.extendNodeEncodings()` mechanism. It was deprecated 5 years ago and didn't work 
    in recent Node versions.
  * Reworked Streaming API behavior in browser environments to fix #204. Streaming API will be 
    excluded by default in browser packs, saving ~100Kb bundle size, unless enabled explicitly using 
    `iconv.enableStreamingAPI(require('stream'))`.
  * Updates to development environment & tests:
    * Added ./test/webpack private package to test complex new use cases that need custom environment. 
      It's tested as a separate job in Travis CI.
    * Updated generation code for the new EUC-KR index file format from Encoding Standard.
    * Removed Buffer() constructor in tests (#197 by @gabrielschulhof).
## 0.5.2 / 2020-06-08
  * Added `iconv.getEncoder()` and `iconv.getDecoder()` methods to typescript definitions (#229).
  * Fixed semver version to 6.1.2 to support Node 8.x (by @tanandara).
  * Capped iconv version to 2.x as 3.x has dropped support for older Node versions.
  * Switched from instanbul to c8 for code coverage.
## 0.5.1 / 2020-01-18
  * Added cp720 encoding (#221, by @kr-deps)
  * (minor) Changed Changelog.md formatting to use h2. 
## 0.5.0 / 2019-06-26
  * Added UTF-32 encoding, both little-endian and big-endian variants (UTF-32LE, UTF32-BE). If endianness
    is not provided for decoding, it's deduced automatically from the stream using a heuristic similar to
    what we use in UTF-16. (great work in #216 by @kshetline)
  * Several minor updates to README (#217 by @oldj, plus some more)
  * Added Node versions 10 and 12 to Travis test harness.
## 0.4.24 / 2018-08-22
  * Added MIK encoding (#196, by @Ivan-Kalatchev)
## 0.4.23 / 2018-05-07
  * Fix deprecation warning in Node v10 due to the last usage of `new Buffer` (#185, by @felixbuenemann)
  * Switched from NodeBuffer to Buffer in typings (#155 by @felixfbecker, #186 by @larssn)
## 0.4.22 / 2018-05-05
  * Use older semver style for dependencies to be compatible with Node version 0.10 (#182, by @dougwilson)
  * Fix tests to accomodate fixes in Node v10 (#182, by @dougwilson)
## 0.4.21 / 2018-04-06
  * Fix encoding canonicalization (#156)
  * Fix the paths in the "browser" field in package.json (#174 by @LMLB)
  * Removed "contributors" section in package.json - see Git history instead.
## 0.4.20 / 2018-04-06
  * Updated `new Buffer()` usages with recommended replacements as it's being deprecated in Node v10 (#176, #178 by @ChALkeR)
## 0.4.19 / 2017-09-09
  * Fixed iso8859-1 codec regression in handling untranslatable characters (#162, caused by #147)
  * Re-generated windows1255 codec, because it was updated in iconv project
  * Fixed grammar in error message when iconv-lite is loaded with encoding other than utf8
## 0.4.18 / 2017-06-13
  * Fixed CESU-8 regression in Node v8.
## 0.4.17 / 2017-04-22
 * Updated typescript definition file to support Angular 2 AoT mode (#153 by @larssn)
## 0.4.16 / 2017-04-22
 * Added support for React Native (#150)
 * Changed iso8859-1 encoding to usine internal 'binary' encoding, as it's the same thing (#147 by @mscdex)
 * Fixed typo in Readme (#138 by @jiangzhuo)
 * Fixed build for Node v6.10+ by making correct version comparison
 * Added a warning if iconv-lite is loaded not as utf-8 (see #142)
## 0.4.15 / 2016-11-21
 * Fixed typescript type definition (#137)
## 0.4.14 / 2016-11-20
 * Preparation for v1.0
 * Added Node v6 and latest Node versions to Travis CI test rig
 * Deprecated Node v0.8 support
 * Typescript typings (@larssn)
 * Fix encoding of Euro character in GB 18030 (inspired by @lygstate)
 * Add ms prefix to dbcs windows encodings (@rokoroku)
## 0.4.13 / 2015-10-01
 * Fix silly mistake in deprecation notice.
## 0.4.12 / 2015-09-26
 * Node v4 support:
   * Added CESU-8 decoding (#106)
   * Added deprecation notice for `extendNodeEncodings`
   * Added Travis tests for Node v4 and io.js latest (#105 by @Mithgol)
## 0.4.11 / 2015-07-03
 * Added CESU-8 encoding.
## 0.4.10 / 2015-05-26
 * Changed UTF-16 endianness heuristic to take into account any ASCII chars, not
   just spaces. This should minimize the importance of "default" endianness.
## 0.4.9 / 2015-05-24
 * Streamlined BOM handling: strip BOM by default, add BOM when encoding if 
   addBOM: true. Added docs to Readme.
 * UTF16 now uses UTF16-LE by default.
 * Fixed minor issue with big5 encoding.
 * Added io.js testing on Travis; updated node-iconv version to test against.
   Now we just skip testing SBCS encodings that node-iconv doesn't support.
 * (internal refactoring) Updated codec interface to use classes.
 * Use strict mode in all files.
## 0.4.8 / 2015-04-14
 
 * added alias UNICODE-1-1-UTF-7 for UTF-7 encoding (#94)
## 0.4.7 / 2015-02-05

 * stop official support of Node.js v0.8. Should still work, but no guarantees.
   reason: Packages needed for testing are hard to get on Travis CI.
 * work in environment where Object.prototype is monkey patched with enumerable 
   props (#89).


## 0.4.6 / 2015-01-12
 
 * fix rare aliases of single-byte encodings (thanks @mscdex)
 * double the timeout for dbcs tests to make them less flaky on travis


## 0.4.5 / 2014-11-20

 * fix windows-31j and x-sjis encoding support (@nleush)
 * minor fix: undefined variable reference when internal error happens


## 0.4.4 / 2014-07-16

 * added encodings UTF-7 (RFC2152) and UTF-7-IMAP (RFC3501 Section 5.1.3)
 * fixed streaming base64 encoding


## 0.4.3 / 2014-06-14

 * added encodings UTF-16BE and UTF-16 with BOM


## 0.4.2 / 2014-06-12

 * don't throw exception if `extendNodeEncodings()` is called more than once


## 0.4.1 / 2014-06-11

 * codepage 808 added

 * (optional) extend core primitive encodings to make usage even simpler
 * moved from vows to mocha as the testing framework
