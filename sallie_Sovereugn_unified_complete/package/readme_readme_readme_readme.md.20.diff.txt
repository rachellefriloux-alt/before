# p-locate [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/sindresorhus/p-locate.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/github/sindresorhus/p-locate)
> Get the first fulfilled promise that satisfies the provided testing function
Think of it like an async version of [`Array#find`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/find).
$ npm install p-locate
Here we find the first file that exists on disk, in array order.
const pathExists = require('path-exists');
const pLocate = require('p-locate');
const files = [
	'unicorn.png',
	'rainbow.png', // Only this one actually exists on disk
	'pony.png'
];
(async () => {
	const foundPath = await pLocate(files, file => pathExists(file));
	console.log(foundPath);
	//=> 'rainbow'
})();
*The above is just an example. Use [`locate-path`](https://github.com/sindresorhus/locate-path) if you need this.*
### pLocate(input, tester, options?)
Returns a `Promise` that is fulfilled when `tester` resolves to `true` or the iterable is done, or rejects if any of the promises reject. The fulfilled value is the current iterable value or `undefined` if `tester` never resolved to `true`.
#### input
Type: `Iterable<Promise | unknown>`
An iterable of promises/values to test.
#### tester(element)
Type: `Function`
This function will receive resolved values from `input` and is expected to return a `Promise<boolean>` or `boolean`.
#### options
Type: `object`
##### concurrency
Type: `number`\
Default: `Infinity`\
Minimum: `1`
Number of concurrently pending promises returned by `tester`.
##### preserveOrder
Type: `boolean`\
Default: `true`
Preserve `input` order when searching.

Disable this to improve performance if you don't care about the order.

# yocto-queue [![](https://badgen.net/bundlephobia/minzip/yocto-queue)](https://bundlephobia.com/result?p=yocto-queue)
> Tiny queue data structure
You should use this package instead of an array if you do a lot of `Array#push()` and `Array#shift()` on large arrays, since `Array#shift()` has [linear time complexity](https://medium.com/@ariel.salem1989/an-easy-to-use-guide-to-big-o-time-complexity-5dcf4be8a444#:~:text=O(N)%E2%80%94Linear%20Time) *O(n)* while `Queue#dequeue()` has [constant time complexity](https://medium.com/@ariel.salem1989/an-easy-to-use-guide-to-big-o-time-complexity-5dcf4be8a444#:~:text=O(1)%20%E2%80%94%20Constant%20Time) *O(1)*. That makes a huge difference for large arrays.
> A [queue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queue_(abstract_data_type)) is an ordered list of elements where an element is inserted at the end of the queue and is removed from the front of the queue. A queue works based on the first-in, first-out ([FIFO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFO_(computing_and_electronics))) principle.
$ npm install yocto-queue
const Queue = require('yocto-queue');
const queue = new Queue();
queue.enqueue('ü¶Ñ');
queue.enqueue('üåà');
console.log(queue.size);
//=> 2
console.log(...queue);
//=> 'ü¶Ñ üåà'
console.log(queue.dequeue());
//=> 'ü¶Ñ'
console.log(queue.dequeue());
//=> 'üåà'
### `queue = new Queue()`
The instance is an [`Iterable`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Iteration_protocols), which means you can iterate over the queue front to back with a ‚Äúfor‚Ä¶of‚Äù loop, or use spreading to convert the queue to an array. Don't do this unless you really need to though, since it's slow.
#### `.enqueue(value)`
Add a value to the queue.
#### `.dequeue()`
Remove the next value in the queue.
Returns the removed value or `undefined` if the queue is empty.
#### `.clear()`
Clear the queue.
#### `.size`
The size of the queue.
