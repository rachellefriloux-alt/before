# Specific overrides for certain file types or directories

# Test files can have different line length preferences

# Markdown and other documentation files often have less strict line length rules

# JSON files can sometimes benefit from consistent line lengths, but this is often handled by JSON formatters


# Makefile has specific formatting conventions


# LICENSE.md, LICENSE - these might be intended to have no specific overrides or are exceptions to the general rules
# If they should follow the default, no entry is needed here. If they have specific rules, define them.
# For now, assuming they follow default or have no specific rules to override.

# Coverage reports might have unique formatting needs
# 'indent = off' is not a standard editorconfig property.
# If you want to disable indentation for these files, you'd typically rely on linters/formatters for that,
# or if it's about *not* applying the indent_style/indent_size from above, you might omit this section.
# If the intent is to have no indentation applied *at all*, it's a bit tricky with EditorConfig alone.
# For clarity, let's assume the intent was to *not* override the default unless explicitly needed.
# If "indent = off" was a typo and you meant to override indent style/size:
# indent_style = unset # or a specific style if known
# indent_size = unset # or a specific size if known

# tea.yaml has different indent settings

# Consider if LICENSE.md and LICENSE should inherit the general rules or have specific ones.
# If they should inherit the default [*] rules, you don't need separate entries.
# If they have specific rules, define them like this:
# [LICENSE.md]
# indent_size = 4 # Example
# max_line_length = 120 # Example

# [LICENSE]
# indent_size = 4 # Example
# max_line_length = 120 # Example
