## ‚ùì Why
For [historical reasons](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/archive/blogs/larryosterman/why-is-the-dos-path-character), windows followed MS-DOS and used backslash for separating paths rather than slash used for macOS, Linux, and other Posix operating systems. Nowadays, [Windows](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/fileio/naming-a-file?redirectedfrom=MSDN) supports both Slash and Backslash for paths. [Node.js's built-in `path` module](https://nodejs.org/api/path.html) in the default operation of the path module varies based on the operating system on which a Node.js application is running. Specifically, when running on a Windows operating system, the path module will assume that Windows-style paths are being used. **This makes inconsistent code behavior between Windows and POSIX.**
Compared to popular [upath](https://github.com/anodynos/upath), pathe provides **identical exports** of Node.js with normalization on **all operations** and is written in modern **ESM/TypeScript** and has **no dependency on Node.js**!
This package is a drop-in replacement of the Node.js's [path module](https://nodejs.org/api/path.html) module and ensures paths are normalized with slash `/` and work in environments including Node.js.
## üíø Usage
Install using npm or yarn:
```bash
# npm
npm i pathe
# yarn
yarn add pathe
# pnpm
pnpm i pathe
Import:
// ESM / Typescript
import { resolve, matchesGlob } from "pathe";
// CommonJS
const { resolve, matchesGlob } = require("pathe");
Read more about path utils from [Node.js documentation](https://nodejs.org/api/path.html) and rest assured behavior is consistently like POSIX regardless of your input paths format and running platform (the only exception is `delimiter` constant export, it will be set to `;` on windows platform).
### Extra utilities
Pathe exports some extra utilities that do not exist in standard Node.js [path module](https://nodejs.org/api/path.html).
In order to use them, you can import from `pathe/utils` subpath:
```js
import {
  filename,
  normalizeAliases,
  resolveAlias,
  reverseResolveAlias,
} from "pathe/utils";
## License
Made with üíõ Published under the [MIT](./LICENSE) license.
Some code was used from the Node.js project. Glob supported is powered by [zeptomatch](https://github.com/fabiospampinato/zeptomatch).

# yocto-queue [![](https://badgen.net/bundlephobia/minzip/yocto-queue)](https://bundlephobia.com/result?p=yocto-queue)
> Tiny queue data structure
You should use this package instead of an array if you do a lot of `Array#push()` and `Array#shift()` on large arrays, since `Array#shift()` has [linear time complexity](https://medium.com/@ariel.salem1989/an-easy-to-use-guide-to-big-o-time-complexity-5dcf4be8a444#:~:text=O(N)%E2%80%94Linear%20Time) *O(n)* while `Queue#dequeue()` has [constant time complexity](https://medium.com/@ariel.salem1989/an-easy-to-use-guide-to-big-o-time-complexity-5dcf4be8a444#:~:text=O(1)%20%E2%80%94%20Constant%20Time) *O(1)*. That makes a huge difference for large arrays.
> A [queue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queue_(abstract_data_type)) is an ordered list of elements where an element is inserted at the end of the queue and is removed from the front of the queue. A queue works based on the first-in, first-out ([FIFO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFO_(computing_and_electronics))) principle.
## Install
$ npm install yocto-queue
## Usage
const Queue = require('yocto-queue');
const queue = new Queue();
queue.enqueue('ü¶Ñ');
queue.enqueue('üåà');
console.log(queue.size);
//=> 2
console.log(...queue);
//=> 'ü¶Ñ üåà'
console.log(queue.dequeue());
//=> 'ü¶Ñ'
console.log(queue.dequeue());
//=> 'üåà'
## API
### `queue = new Queue()`
The instance is an [`Iterable`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Iteration_protocols), which means you can iterate over the queue front to back with a ‚Äúfor‚Ä¶of‚Äù loop, or use spreading to convert the queue to an array. Don't do this unless you really need to though, since it's slow.
#### `.enqueue(value)`
Add a value to the queue.
#### `.dequeue()`

Remove the next value in the queue.

Returns the removed value or `undefined` if the queue is empty.

#### `.clear()`

Clear the queue.
#### `.size`
The size of the queue.
