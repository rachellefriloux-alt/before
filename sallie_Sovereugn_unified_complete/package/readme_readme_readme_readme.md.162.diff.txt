## Usage Note
This package is inlined into Global & Browser ESM builds of user-facing renderers (e.g. `@vue/runtime-dom`), but also published as a package that can be used standalone. The standalone build should not be used alongside a pre-bundled build of a user-facing renderer, as they will have different internal storage for reactivity connections. A user-facing renderer should re-export all APIs from this package.
For full exposed APIs, see `src/index.ts`.
## Credits
The implementation of this module is inspired by the following prior art in the JavaScript ecosystem:
- [Meteor Tracker](https://docs.meteor.com/api/tracker.html)
- [nx-js/observer-util](https://github.com/nx-js/observer-util)
- [salesforce/observable-membrane](https://github.com/salesforce/observable-membrane)
## Caveats
- Built-in objects are not observed except for `Array`, `Map`, `WeakMap`, `Set` and `WeakSet`.

> Tiny queue data structure
You should use this package instead of an array if you do a lot of `Array#push()` and `Array#shift()` on large arrays, since `Array#shift()` has [linear time complexity](https://medium.com/@ariel.salem1989/an-easy-to-use-guide-to-big-o-time-complexity-5dcf4be8a444#:~:text=O(N)%E2%80%94Linear%20Time) *O(n)* while `Queue#dequeue()` has [constant time complexity](https://medium.com/@ariel.salem1989/an-easy-to-use-guide-to-big-o-time-complexity-5dcf4be8a444#:~:text=O(1)%20%E2%80%94%20Constant%20Time) *O(1)*. That makes a huge difference for large arrays.
> A [queue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queue_(abstract_data_type)) is an ordered list of elements where an element is inserted at the end of the queue and is removed from the front of the queue. A queue works based on the first-in, first-out ([FIFO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFO_(computing_and_electronics))) principle.
## Install
```
$ npm install yocto-queue
```
## Usage
```js
const Queue = require('yocto-queue');
const queue = new Queue();
queue.enqueue('🦄');
queue.enqueue('🌈');

console.log(queue.size);
//=> 2

console.log(...queue);
//=> '🦄 🌈'

console.log(queue.dequeue());
//=> '🦄'

console.log(queue.dequeue());
//=> '🌈'
```

## API

### `queue = new Queue()`

The instance is an [`Iterable`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Iteration_protocols), which means you can iterate over the queue front to back with a “for…of” loop, or use spreading to convert the queue to an array. Don't do this unless you really need to though, since it's slow.

#### `.enqueue(value)`

Add a value to the queue.

#### `.dequeue()`

Remove the next value in the queue.

Returns the removed value or `undefined` if the queue is empty.

#### `.clear()`

Clear the queue.

#### `.size`

The size of the queue.
