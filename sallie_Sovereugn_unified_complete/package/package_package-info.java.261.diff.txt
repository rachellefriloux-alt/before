 * Copyright 2024 the original author or authors.
 * This package contains types for capturing data about the chain of variant transformations that
 * are available to satisfy an artifact selection request.
 * <p>
 * These types are a more lightweight representation of the data in {@link org.gradle.api.internal.artifacts.transform.TransformedVariant TransformedVariant},
 * and related types that allow us to package this data for external consumers without exposing internal dependency resolution types.  These
 * contain all the interesting data about any transformation chains necessary to analyze a failure and describe it
 * using a {@link org.gradle.internal.component.resolution.failure.describer.ResolutionFailureDescriber ResolutionFailureDescriber}.
 * <p>
 * One important property of these types is that they do not pose problems to serialization in
 * {@link org.gradle.internal.operations.BuildOperation BuildOperation}s and traces.
