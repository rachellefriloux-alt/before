# Tinypool - the node.js worker pool üßµ
> Piscina: A fast, efficient Node.js Worker Thread Pool implementation
Tinypool is a fork of piscina. What we try to achieve in this library, is to eliminate some dependencies and features that our target users don't need (currently, our main user will be Vitest). Tinypool's install size (38KB) can then be smaller than Piscina's install size (6MB when Tinypool was created, Piscina has since reduced it's size to ~800KB). If you need features like [utilization](https://github.com/piscinajs/piscina#property-utilization-readonly) or OS-specific thread priority setting, [Piscina](https://github.com/piscinajs/piscina) is a better choice for you. We think that Piscina is an amazing library, and we may try to upstream some of the dependencies optimization in this fork.
- ‚úÖ Smaller install size, 38KB
- ‚úÖ Minimal
- ‚úÖ No dependencies
- ‚úÖ Physical cores instead of Logical cores with [physical-cpu-count](https://www.npmjs.com/package/physical-cpu-count)
- ‚úÖ Supports `worker_threads` and `child_process`
- ‚ùå No utilization
- ‚ùå No OS-specific thread priority setting
- Written in TypeScript, and ESM support only. For Node.js 18.x and higher.

> Tiny queue data structure
You should use this package instead of an array if you do a lot of `Array#push()` and `Array#shift()` on large arrays, since `Array#shift()` has [linear time complexity](https://medium.com/@ariel.salem1989/an-easy-to-use-guide-to-big-o-time-complexity-5dcf4be8a444#:~:text=O(N)%E2%80%94Linear%20Time) *O(n)* while `Queue#dequeue()` has [constant time complexity](https://medium.com/@ariel.salem1989/an-easy-to-use-guide-to-big-o-time-complexity-5dcf4be8a444#:~:text=O(1)%20%E2%80%94%20Constant%20Time) *O(1)*. That makes a huge difference for large arrays.
> A [queue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queue_(abstract_data_type)) is an ordered list of elements where an element is inserted at the end of the queue and is removed from the front of the queue. A queue works based on the first-in, first-out ([FIFO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFO_(computing_and_electronics))) principle.
## Install

```
$ npm install yocto-queue
```
## Usage
```js
const Queue = require('yocto-queue');

const queue = new Queue();
queue.enqueue('ü¶Ñ');
queue.enqueue('üåà');

console.log(queue.size);
//=> 2

console.log(...queue);
//=> 'ü¶Ñ üåà'

console.log(queue.dequeue());
//=> 'ü¶Ñ'

console.log(queue.dequeue());
//=> 'üåà'
```

## API

### `queue = new Queue()`

The instance is an [`Iterable`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Iteration_protocols), which means you can iterate over the queue front to back with a ‚Äúfor‚Ä¶of‚Äù loop, or use spreading to convert the queue to an array. Don't do this unless you really need to though, since it's slow.

#### `.enqueue(value)`

Add a value to the queue.

#### `.dequeue()`

Remove the next value in the queue.

Returns the removed value or `undefined` if the queue is empty.

#### `.clear()`

Clear the queue.

#### `.size`

The size of the queue.
