# 1.0.0
* massive update - separated functions into separate modules
* functions do not accept multiple types anymore - use different versions in their respective modules in some cases (eg. `Obj.map`), or use `chars` or `values` in other cases to transform into a list
* objects are no longer transformed into functions, simply use `(obj.)` in LiveScript to do that
* browser version now using browserify - use `prelude = require('prelude-ls')`
* added `compact`, `split`, `flatten`, `difference`, `intersection`, `union`, `count-by`, `group-by`, `chars`, `unchars`, `apply`
* added `lists-to-obj` which takes a list of keys and list of values and zips them up into an object, and the converse `obj-to-lists`
* added `pairs-to-obj` which takes a list of pairs (2 element lists) and creates an object, and the converse `obj-to-pairs`
* removed `cons`, `append` - use the concat operator
* removed `compose` - use the compose operator
* removed `obj-to-func` - use partially applied access (eg. `(obj.)`)
* removed `length` - use `(.length)`
* `sort-by` renamed to `sort-with`
* added new `sort-by`
* removed `compare` - just use the new `sort-by`
* `break-it` renamed `break-list`, (`Str.break-str` for the string version)
* added `Str.repeat` which creates a new string by repeating the input n times
* `unfold` as alias to `unfoldr` is no longer used
* fixed up style and compiled with LiveScript 1.1.1
* use Make instead of Slake
* greatly improved tests
# 0.6.0
* fixed various bugs
* added `fix`, a fixpoint (Y combinator) for anonymous recursive functions
* added `unfoldr` (alias `unfold`)
* calling `replicate` with a string now returns a list of strings
* removed `partial`, just use native partial application in LiveScript using the `_` placeholder, or currying
* added `sort`, `sortBy`, and `compare`
# 0.5.0
* removed `lookup` - use (.prop)
