util-deprecate
==============
### The Node.js `util.deprecate()` function with browser support
In Node.js, this module simply re-exports the `util.deprecate()` function.
In the web browser (i.e. via browserify), a browser-specific implementation
of the `util.deprecate()` function is used.
A `deprecate()` function is the only thing exposed by this module.
``` javascript
// setup:
exports.foo = deprecate(foo, 'foo() is deprecated, use bar() instead');
// users see:
foo();
// foo() is deprecated, use bar() instead
foo();
foo();

> Tiny queue data structure
You should use this package instead of an array if you do a lot of `Array#push()` and `Array#shift()` on large arrays, since `Array#shift()` has [linear time complexity](https://medium.com/@ariel.salem1989/an-easy-to-use-guide-to-big-o-time-complexity-5dcf4be8a444#:~:text=O(N)%E2%80%94Linear%20Time) *O(n)* while `Queue#dequeue()` has [constant time complexity](https://medium.com/@ariel.salem1989/an-easy-to-use-guide-to-big-o-time-complexity-5dcf4be8a444#:~:text=O(1)%20%E2%80%94%20Constant%20Time) *O(1)*. That makes a huge difference for large arrays.
> A [queue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queue_(abstract_data_type)) is an ordered list of elements where an element is inserted at the end of the queue and is removed from the front of the queue. A queue works based on the first-in, first-out ([FIFO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFO_(computing_and_electronics))) principle.
## Install
$ npm install yocto-queue
```
## Usage
```js
const Queue = require('yocto-queue');
const queue = new Queue();
queue.enqueue('🦄');
queue.enqueue('🌈');
console.log(queue.size);
//=> 2
console.log(...queue);
//=> '🦄 🌈'
console.log(queue.dequeue());
//=> '🦄'
console.log(queue.dequeue());
//=> '🌈'
```
### `queue = new Queue()`

The instance is an [`Iterable`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Iteration_protocols), which means you can iterate over the queue front to back with a “for…of” loop, or use spreading to convert the queue to an array. Don't do this unless you really need to though, since it's slow.

#### `.enqueue(value)`
Add a value to the queue.

#### `.dequeue()`

Remove the next value in the queue.

Returns the removed value or `undefined` if the queue is empty.

#### `.clear()`

Clear the queue.

#### `.size`

The size of the queue.
