The ultimate javascript content-type utility.
Similar to [the `mime@1.x` module](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mime), except:
- __No fallbacks.__ Instead of naively returning the first available type,
  `mime-types` simply returns `false`, so do
  `var type = mime.lookup('unrecognized') || 'application/octet-stream'`.
- No `new Mime()` business, so you could do `var lookup = require('mime-types').lookup`.
- No `.define()` functionality
- Bug fixes for `.lookup(path)`
Otherwise, the API is compatible with `mime` 1.x.
This is a [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) module available through the
[npm registry](https://www.npmjs.com/). Installation is done using the
[`npm install` command](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-npm-packages-locally):
```sh
$ npm install mime-types
## Note on MIME Type Data and Semver
This package considers the programmatic api as the semver compatibility. Additionally, the package which provides the MIME data
for this package (`mime-db`) *also* considers it's programmatic api as the semver contract. This means the MIME type resolution is *not* considered
in the semver bumps.
In the past the version of `mime-db` was pinned to give two decision points when adopting MIME data changes. This is no longer true. We still update the
`mime-db` package here as a `minor` release when necessary, but will use a `^` range going forward. This means that if you want to pin your `mime-db` data
you will need to do it in your application. While this expectation was not set in docs until now, it is how the pacakge operated, so we do not feel this is
a breaking change.
If you wish to pin your `mime-db` version you can do that with overrides via your package manager of choice. See their documentation for how to correctly configure that.
## Adding Types
All mime types are based on [mime-db](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mime-db),
so open a PR there if you'd like to add mime types.
var mime = require('mime-types')
All functions return `false` if input is invalid or not found.
### mime.lookup(path)
Lookup the content-type associated with a file.
```js
mime.lookup('json') // 'application/json'
mime.lookup('.md') // 'text/markdown'
mime.lookup('file.html') // 'text/html'
mime.lookup('folder/file.js') // 'application/javascript'
mime.lookup('folder/.htaccess') // false
mime.lookup('cats') // false
### mime.contentType(type)
Create a full content-type header given a content-type or extension.
When given an extension, `mime.lookup` is used to get the matching
content-type, otherwise the given content-type is used. Then if the
content-type does not already have a `charset` parameter, `mime.charset`
is used to get the default charset and add to the returned content-type.
```js
mime.contentType('markdown') // 'text/x-markdown; charset=utf-8'
mime.contentType('file.json') // 'application/json; charset=utf-8'
mime.contentType('text/html') // 'text/html; charset=utf-8'
mime.contentType('text/html; charset=iso-8859-1') // 'text/html; charset=iso-8859-1'
// from a full path
mime.contentType(path.extname('/path/to/file.json')) // 'application/json; charset=utf-8'
```
### mime.extension(type)
Get the default extension for a content-type.
```js
mime.extension('application/octet-stream') // 'bin'
```

### mime.charset(type)

Lookup the implied default charset of a content-type.

```js
mime.charset('text/markdown') // 'UTF-8'
```

### var type = mime.types[extension]

A map of content-types by extension.

### [extensions...] = mime.extensions[type]

A map of extensions by content-type.

# yocto-queue [![](https://badgen.net/bundlephobia/minzip/yocto-queue)](https://bundlephobia.com/result?p=yocto-queue)
> Tiny queue data structure
You should use this package instead of an array if you do a lot of `Array#push()` and `Array#shift()` on large arrays, since `Array#shift()` has [linear time complexity](https://medium.com/@ariel.salem1989/an-easy-to-use-guide-to-big-o-time-complexity-5dcf4be8a444#:~:text=O(N)%E2%80%94Linear%20Time) *O(n)* while `Queue#dequeue()` has [constant time complexity](https://medium.com/@ariel.salem1989/an-easy-to-use-guide-to-big-o-time-complexity-5dcf4be8a444#:~:text=O(1)%20%E2%80%94%20Constant%20Time) *O(1)*. That makes a huge difference for large arrays.
> A [queue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queue_(abstract_data_type)) is an ordered list of elements where an element is inserted at the end of the queue and is removed from the front of the queue. A queue works based on the first-in, first-out ([FIFO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFO_(computing_and_electronics))) principle.
$ npm install yocto-queue
## Usage
const Queue = require('yocto-queue');
const queue = new Queue();
queue.enqueue('🦄');
queue.enqueue('🌈');
console.log(queue.size);
//=> 2
console.log(...queue);
//=> '🦄 🌈'
console.log(queue.dequeue());
//=> '🦄'
console.log(queue.dequeue());
//=> '🌈'
### `queue = new Queue()`
The instance is an [`Iterable`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Iteration_protocols), which means you can iterate over the queue front to back with a “for…of” loop, or use spreading to convert the queue to an array. Don't do this unless you really need to though, since it's slow.
#### `.enqueue(value)`
Add a value to the queue.
#### `.dequeue()`
Remove the next value in the queue.
Returns the removed value or `undefined` if the queue is empty.
#### `.clear()`
Clear the queue.
#### `.size`
The size of the queue.
