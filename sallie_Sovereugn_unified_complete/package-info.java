 * This package contains a hierarchy of {@link org.gradle.internal.component.resolution.failure.interfaces.ResolutionFailure ResolutionFailure}
 * interfaces that exist to categorize types of failure conditions that can occur during dependency resolution and

 * <p>
 * There are currently 4 different categories of resolution failures processed by the
 * {@link org.gradle.internal.component.resolution.failure.ResolutionFailureHandler ResolutionFailureHandler}.  There may be
 * more in the future.
 * <p>
 * These categories are represented by the immediate children of
 * {@link org.gradle.internal.component.resolution.failure.interfaces.ResolutionFailure ResolutionFailure}:
 * <ol>
 *     <li>{@link org.gradle.internal.component.resolution.failure.interfaces.ComponentSelectionFailure}</li>
 *     <li>{@link org.gradle.internal.component.resolution.failure.interfaces.VariantSelectionFailure}</li>

 *     <li>{@link org.gradle.internal.component.resolution.failure.interfaces.ArtifactSelectionFailure}</li>
 * </ol>
 * This list is ordered, as the selection of any given artifact can fail the resolution process in many ways.
 * A failure that occurs in any one category in this list will always have the same information available to it.  If a
 * failure occurs in category ordered below it, fixing the failure can <strong>NOT</strong> result in a different failure
 * in an earlier category, but it may "unblock" a latent failure in a later category.
 * <p>
 * All concrete failures in the {@link org.gradle.internal.component.resolution.failure.type} package should
 * implement exactly one of these interfaces.

/**
 * This subsystem implements serialization of configuration state.
 * <h2>Key abstractions</h2>
 *
 * <h3>Encoders and Decoders</h3>
 *  <p>
 *  Serialization of an object that is supported by the configuration cache is performed by an {@link org.gradle.internal.serialize.graph.EncodingProvider}.
 *  Deserialization, on the other hand, is performed by a {@link org.gradle.internal.serialize.graph.DecodingProvider}.
 *  </p>
 *  <p>Both protocols are highly specialized and, as such, they are specified as Single Abstract Method interfaces.</p>
 *
 *  <h3>Codecs</h3>
 *  <p>A {@link org.gradle.internal.serialize.graph.Codec Codec} is an object that is both an <code>EncodingProvider</code> and a <code>DecodingProvider</code>.</p>
 *  <p>Codecs may be implemented:
 *  <ul>
 *  <li>as a custom class that implements both encoding and decoding protocols in the same class
 *  <li>based on the combination of arbitrary encoder and decoder functions, as done via {@link org.gradle.internal.serialize.graph.CombinatorsKt#codec(kotlin.jvm.functions.Function3, kotlin.jvm.functions.Function2) codec(...)}
 *  <li>or as composite/multi-type codecs, backed by a set of bindings, via {@link org.gradle.internal.serialize.graph.codecs.Bindings#build()} - see below for more on Bindings.
 *  </ul>
 *
 * <h3>Building Composite Codecs using Bindings</h3>
 * <p>In order to build composite codecs that can handle multiple types of objects, you use {@link org.gradle.internal.serialize.graph.codecs.Bindings bindings}.</p>
 * <p>
 *  Each single {@link org.gradle.internal.serialize.graph.codecs.Binding binding} comprises:
 *  <ul>
 *     <li>a <em>tag</em> (a unique numeric identifier that represents the type the binding supports)
 *     <li>the {@link org.gradle.internal.serialize.graph.EncodingProvider encoding provider} <em>{@link org.gradle.internal.serialize.graph.EncodingProvider producer}</em>
 *     <li>the {@link org.gradle.internal.serialize.graph.DecodingProvider decoding provider}
 *  </ul>
 *  <p>
 *  On serialization of an object of some type, the {@link org.gradle.internal.serialize.graph.codecs.BindingsBackedCodec bindings-backed composite codec}
 *  will query all bindings to find which one knows how to encode the type at hand,
 *  by invoking {@link org.gradle.internal.serialize.graph.codecs.Binding#encodingForType(java.lang.Class)} on each binding. If a binding supports the type,
 *  it will return the proper {@link org.gradle.internal.serialize.graph.EncodingProvider} (or null, otherwise).
 *  </p><p>
 *  Deserializing is simpler: the bindings-backed composite codec reads a tag from the stored state, and then picks the binding that is associated with that tag (and consequently, that binding's decoder).
 *  </p>
 *
 *  <h3>WriteContext</h3>
 *  <p>
 *      Before serialization starts, a {@link org.gradle.internal.serialize.graph.WriteContext} is created.
 *      The WriteContext keeps track (among other things) of the low level binary stream (actually, a Gradle serialization {@link org.gradle.internal.serialize.Encoder Encoder}) and the codec to be used.
 *  </p>
 *  <p>
 *      Object serialization is a graph-walking process, and as such, it has a recursive nature.
 *  </p>
 *  <p></p>
 *      In order to serialize one object, {@link  org.gradle.internal.serialize.graph.WriteContext#write(java.lang.Object, kotlin.coroutines.Continuation) WriteContext.write(object)} must be invoked.
 *  </p>
 *  <p><code>WriteContext.write(object)</code> then delegates to {@link org.gradle.internal.serialize.graph.Codec#encode(WriteContext, java.lang.Object, kotlin.coroutines.Continuation) Codec.encode(WriteContext, Object)}.</p>
 *  <p>A codec implementation will, generally:
 *  <ul>
 *      <li>encode the primitive/non-object values directly by invoking some of the various {@link org.gradle.internal.serialize.Encoder Encoder}'s <code>write*</code> variants</li>
 *      <li>encode any related/contained objects by delegating to {@link  org.gradle.internal.serialize.graph.WriteContext#write(java.lang.Object, kotlin.coroutines.Continuation) WriteContext.write(object)} passing the related object.</li>
 *  </ul>
 *  </p>

/**
 * This package contains the base implementations for the {@link org.gradle.api.provider.Provider provider} and {@link org.gradle.api.provider.Property lazy property} abstractions.
 *
 * <p>Providers are container objects that provide a value of a specific type.</p>
 *
 * <p>Properties are providers with configurable values.</p>
 *
 * <h2>Provider</h2>
 *
 * <p>For the public API, see {@link org.gradle.api.provider.Provider Provider}.</p>
 *
 * <p>For more information on providers, beyond what the user-facing documentation and API offer,
 * see the {@link org.gradle.api.internal.provider.ProviderInternal} interface.</p>
 *
 * <p>Also, make sure to become familiar with {@link org.gradle.api.internal.provider.AbstractMinimalProvider},
 * the base class for all provider (and property) implementations.</p>
 *
 * <h3>Lazy properties</h3>
 *
 * <p>For the public API, see {@link org.gradle.api.provider.Property Property}.</p>
 *
 * <p>For the base internal implementation, see {@link org.gradle.api.internal.provider.AbstractProperty}.</p>
 *
 * <p>Other classes implementing <code>Property</code> in this module:</p>
 * <ul>
 *     <li>{@link org.gradle.api.internal.provider.DefaultProperty} - a concrete implementation for general-purpose properties.</li>
 *     <li>{@link org.gradle.api.internal.provider.AbstractCollectionProperty} - implements the API for
 *     collection properties (specified via {@link org.gradle.api.provider.HasMultipleValues HasMultipleValues}) namely {@link org.gradle.api.provider.ListProperty list} and {@link org.gradle.api.provider.SetProperty set} properties).</li>
 *     <li>{@link org.gradle.api.internal.provider.DefaultMapProperty} - implements the {@link org.gradle.api.provider.MapProperty map} property API.
 *     Note that this class and <code>AbstractCollectionProperty</code> have a lot of duplication, as they implement very similar contracts.
 * </ul>

/**
 * This package contains a hierarchy of {@link org.gradle.internal.component.resolution.failure.interfaces.ResolutionFailure ResolutionFailure}
 * interfaces that exist to categorize types of failure conditions that can occur during dependency resolution and
 * delineate when during dependency resolution a failure occurred.
 * <p>
 * There are currently 4 different categories of resolution failures processed by the
 * {@link org.gradle.internal.component.resolution.failure.ResolutionFailureHandler ResolutionFailureHandler}.  There may be
 * more in the future.
 * <p>
 * These categories are represented by the immediate children of
 * {@link org.gradle.internal.component.resolution.failure.interfaces.ResolutionFailure ResolutionFailure}:
 * <ol>
 *     <li>{@link org.gradle.internal.component.resolution.failure.interfaces.ComponentSelectionFailure}</li>
 *     <li>{@link org.gradle.internal.component.resolution.failure.interfaces.VariantSelectionFailure}</li>
 *     <li>{@link org.gradle.internal.component.resolution.failure.interfaces.GraphValidationFailure}</li>
 *     <li>{@link org.gradle.internal.component.resolution.failure.interfaces.ArtifactSelectionFailure}</li>
 * </ol>
 * This list is ordered, as the selection of any given artifact can fail the resolution process in many ways.
 * A failure that occurs in any one category in this list will always have the same information available to it.  If a
 * failure occurs in category ordered below it, fixing the failure can <strong>NOT</strong> result in a different failure
 * in an earlier category, but it may "unblock" a latent failure in a later category.
 * <p>
 * All concrete failures in the {@link org.gradle.internal.component.resolution.failure.type} package should
 * implement exactly one of these interfaces.

/**
 * This subsystem implements serialization of configuration state.
 * <h2>Key abstractions</h2>
 *
 * <h3>Encoders and Decoders</h3>
 *  <p>
 *  Serialization of an object that is supported by the configuration cache is performed by an {@link org.gradle.internal.serialize.graph.EncodingProvider}.
 *  Deserialization, on the other hand, is performed by a {@link org.gradle.internal.serialize.graph.DecodingProvider}.
 *  </p>
 *  <p>Both protocols are highly specialized and, as such, they are specified as Single Abstract Method interfaces.</p>
 *
 *  <h3>Codecs</h3>
 *  <p>A {@link org.gradle.internal.serialize.graph.Codec Codec} is an object that is both an <code>EncodingProvider</code> and a <code>DecodingProvider</code>.</p>
 *  <p>Codecs may be implemented:
 *  <ul>
 *  <li>as a custom class that implements both encoding and decoding protocols in the same class
 *  <li>based on the combination of arbitrary encoder and decoder functions, as done via {@link org.gradle.internal.serialize.graph.CombinatorsKt#codec(kotlin.jvm.functions.Function3, kotlin.jvm.functions.Function2) codec(...)}
 *  <li>or as composite/multi-type codecs, backed by a set of bindings, via {@link org.gradle.internal.serialize.graph.codecs.Bindings#build()} - see below for more on Bindings.
 *  </ul>
 *
 * <h3>Building Composite Codecs using Bindings</h3>
 * <p>In order to build composite codecs that can handle multiple types of objects, you use {@link org.gradle.internal.serialize.graph.codecs.Bindings bindings}.</p>
 * <p>
 *  Each single {@link org.gradle.internal.serialize.graph.codecs.Binding binding} comprises:
 *  <ul>
 *     <li>a <em>tag</em> (a unique numeric identifier that represents the type the binding supports)
 *     <li>the {@link org.gradle.internal.serialize.graph.EncodingProvider encoding provider} <em>{@link org.gradle.internal.serialize.graph.EncodingProvider producer}</em>
 *     <li>the {@link org.gradle.internal.serialize.graph.DecodingProvider decoding provider}
 *  </ul>
 *  <p>
 *  On serialization of an object of some type, the {@link org.gradle.internal.serialize.graph.codecs.BindingsBackedCodec bindings-backed composite codec}
 *  will query all bindings to find which one knows how to encode the type at hand,
 *  by invoking {@link org.gradle.internal.serialize.graph.codecs.Binding#encodingForType(java.lang.Class)} on each binding. If a binding supports the type,
 *  it will return the proper {@link org.gradle.internal.serialize.graph.EncodingProvider} (or null, otherwise).
 *  </p><p>
 *  Deserializing is simpler: the bindings-backed composite codec reads a tag from the stored state, and then picks the binding that is associated with that tag (and consequently, that binding's decoder).
 *  </p>
 *
 *  <h3>WriteContext</h3>
 *  <p>
 *      Before serialization starts, a {@link org.gradle.internal.serialize.graph.WriteContext} is created.
 *      The WriteContext keeps track (among other things) of the low level binary stream (actually, a Gradle serialization {@link org.gradle.internal.serialize.Encoder Encoder}) and the codec to be used.
 *  </p>
 *  <p>
 *      Object serialization is a graph-walking process, and as such, it has a recursive nature.

/**
 * This package contains the base implementations for the {@link org.gradle.api.provider.Provider provider} and {@link org.gradle.api.provider.Property lazy property} abstractions.
 *
 * <p>Providers are container objects that provide a value of a specific type.</p>
 *
 * <p>Properties are providers with configurable values.</p>
 *
 * <h2>Provider</h2>
 *
 * <p>For the public API, see {@link org.gradle.api.provider.Provider Provider}.</p>
 *
 * <p>For more information on providers, beyond what the user-facing documentation and API offer,
 * see the {@link org.gradle.api.internal.provider.ProviderInternal} interface.</p>
 *
 * <p>Also, make sure to become familiar with {@link org.gradle.api.internal.provider.AbstractMinimalProvider},
 * the base class for all provider (and property) implementations.</p>
 *
 * <h3>Lazy properties</h3>
 *
 * <p>For the public API, see {@link org.gradle.api.provider.Property Property}.</p>
 *
 * <p>For the base internal implementation, see {@link org.gradle.api.internal.provider.AbstractProperty}.</p>
 *
 * <p>Other classes implementing <code>Property</code> in this module:</p>
 * <ul>
 *     <li>{@link org.gradle.api.internal.provider.DefaultProperty} - a concrete implementation for general-purpose properties.</li>
 *     <li>{@link org.gradle.api.internal.provider.AbstractCollectionProperty} - implements the API for
 *     collection properties (specified via {@link org.gradle.api.provider.HasMultipleValues HasMultipleValues}) namely {@link org.gradle.api.provider.ListProperty list} and {@link org.gradle.api.provider.SetProperty set} properties).</li>
 *     <li>{@link org.gradle.api.internal.provider.DefaultMapProperty} - implements the {@link org.gradle.api.provider.MapProperty map} property API.
 *     Note that this class and <code>AbstractCollectionProperty</code> have a lot of duplication, as they implement very similar contracts.
 * </ul>
