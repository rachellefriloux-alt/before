   - Weighted preference system for fine-grained control

2. **NaturalLanguageProcessor.kt**
   - Sophisticated intent detection for queries, commands, social, and emotional messages
   - Entity extraction for names, dates, times, locations, and other important entities
   - Sentiment analysis to understand user emotions
   - Text normalization and preprocessing
   - Tone transformation capabilities for adapting system responses

3. **SocialIntelligenceEngine.kt**
   - Conversation context tracking and management
   - Conversation phase detection (opening, middle, closing)
   - Relationship modeling for appropriate social dynamics
   - Response mode selection based on context and intent
   - Cultural awareness and adaptation

4. **CommunicationBridge.kt**
   - Central integration point for all communication components
   - Conversation lifecycle management (start, process, end)
   - Message routing and processing pipeline
   - Unified API for communication capabilities
   - Error handling and recovery mechanisms

5. **Data Models**
   - Message model for representing conversation messages
   - ConversationState for tracking conversation context
   - ToneAttributes for customizable communication style
   - Response modes for different communication approaches
   - Conversation types for different interaction scenarios

## UI Components

1. **CommunicationPanel.vue**
   - Interactive messaging interface for web/desktop applications
   - Message display with appropriate formatting
   - Input controls with tone customization options
   - Real-time conversation feedback

2. **activity_communication_demo.xml & CommunicationDemoActivity.java**
   - Full demonstration of the Communication System on Android
   - Interactive conversation with tone adjustment controls
   - Conversation type selection and message history display
   - Visual indication of message intent and response modes

## Documentation and Testing

1. **Comprehensive Documentation**
   - Detailed implementation guide in CommunicationSystem_Implementation.md
   - Usage examples and integration guidelines
   - Architecture diagrams and component relationships
   - Future enhancement recommendations

2. **Extensive Testing**
   - Unit tests for ToneManager (ToneManagerTest.kt)
   - Unit tests for NaturalLanguageProcessor (NaturalLanguageProcessorTest.kt)
   - Unit tests for SocialIntelligenceEngine (SocialIntelligenceEngineTest.kt)
   - Unit tests for CommunicationBridge (CommunicationBridgeTest.kt)

## Integration Points

The Communication System integrates with other Sallie components:

1. **Emotional Intelligence System**: For emotion-aware responses
2. **Personality System**: For personality-consistent communication
3. **Memory System**: For contextual conversation history
4. **UI Framework**: For visual representation of conversations
