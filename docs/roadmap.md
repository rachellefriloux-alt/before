# Sallie Roadmap

This roadmap merges all content from INTEGRATION_ENHANCEMENT_PLAN.md and tracks Sallie's integration, enhancement, and future development milestones.

---

## Objective

Integrate, expand, and enhance all migrated and pending modules from `sallie_1.00` into the `Sallie` folder, ensuring launch readiness and full feature connectivity. All optional enhancements and advanced features will be included.

## Sallie Full Integration & Enhancement Plan

## 1. Core & Feature Module Expansion

- [x] All migrated modules reviewed for completeness
- [x] All modules expanded with advanced features:
	- Context-aware conversation (see PersonaEngine.kt)
	- Advanced personality evolution (see PersonalityEvolutionDemoActivity.kt)
 	- Autonomous skill acquisition & recommendation (see ResearchLearningSystem.js)
 	- Device transfer & control (see DeviceControlDemoActivity.kt)
 	- Multimodal input & voice/ASR integration (see EmotionalIntelligence.js)
 	- Persistence layer & cross-device sync (see HierarchicalMemoryManager.kt)
 	- Creative expression (multi-domain, collaborative) (see AdaptiveConversationSystem.js)
 	- Technical capabilities (programming, research, optimization) (see EnhancedTechnicalCapabilitiesOrchestrator.js)
- [x] All stubs/TODOs removed and missing logic implemented
- [x] Usage examples and demo routines added in docs and code

## 2. Integration & Connectivity

- [x] Imports/exports updated for compatibility
- [x] Device control, memory, personality, creative, and technical modules fully connected
- [x] UI components and accessibility features integrated
- [x] Server/app entry points linked to new modules

## 3. Launch Readiness

- [x] App launch process and main flows validated
- [x] Tests and demo routines added for all major features
- [x] All enhancements and optional features included

## 4. Documentation & Review

- [x] All enhancements and integration steps documented
- [x] README and enhancement summary files updated
- [x] Reviewed for completeness and best practices
