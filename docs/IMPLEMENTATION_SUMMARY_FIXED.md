# Sallie 2.0 - Implementation Summary

## âœ… **COMPLETED - Enhanced Cognitive, Visual & Advanced Interactive Systems**

### Advanced Cognitive Architecture

- **Hierarchical Memory System** with episodic, semantic, emotional, and procedural layers
- **Enhanced Learning Engine** with pattern recognition and experiential learning
- **Knowledge Synthesis System** for cross-domain intelligence and insights
- **Autonomous Skill System** for self-directed learning and skill acquisition
- **Values System** with pro-life foundation and traditional/modern balance
- **Visual Customization System** for mood and activity-based adaptation
- **Integration System** connecting cognitive and visual components
- **Advanced Personality Evolution System** for natural growth while maintaining core traits

### Technical Implementation Details

#### Memory Architecture

- **Hierarchical Memory System** with four distinct memory types:
  - **Episodic Memory:** Records personal experiences and events
  - **Semantic Memory:** Stores factual knowledge and concepts
  - **Emotional Memory:** Captures emotional responses and associations
  - **Procedural Memory:** Remembers skills, processes, and procedures

- **Memory Connections** allow for associative memory retrieval
- **Memory Importance and Certainty** metrics for prioritization
- **Memory Search and Retrieval** optimized for different query types

#### Learning Systems

- **Pattern Recognition** across diverse information sources
- **Experiential Learning** from user interactions
- **Knowledge Domain Categorization** for organized learning
- **Cross-Domain Intelligence** connecting disparate knowledge areas
- **Meta-Cognitive Insights** about knowledge gaps and conflicts

#### Values Foundation
